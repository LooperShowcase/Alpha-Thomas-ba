      Real Madrid is celebrating 91 years since the clubs first ever league
      title. On April 3, 1932, the Whites earned their first silverware in this
      competition with a 2-2 draw at Barcelona on the last day of the season.
      Lazcano and Luis Regueiro netted the goals for Madrid in the match. Real
      Madrid ended that league competition, which comprised 10 teams, in first
      place on 28 points and without losing a single game. They were closely
      followed by Athletic 25 and Barcelona 24. Also, Real Madrid conceded the
      fewest goals 15, making Ricardo Zamora the first Madrid goalkeeper to win
      the trophy that bears his name. This award was established in the 1958/59
      season, although the Marca newspaper symbolically honoured the goalkeepers
      who had conceded the fewest goals in previous seasons. Olivares finished
      as the team's top scorer in that season, with 10 goals. Hungarian Lippo
      Hertzka was the coach of the club's first league title. 91 years after the
      first league title, Real Madrid dominate the competition's honours list
      with 35 league titles.

    <p>The first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club,
        "MCF" for Madrid Club de Fútbol, in dark blue on a white shirt.
        The first change in the crest occurred </p>

       <p>in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined
         form and appeared inside a circle.
        [179] The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until
         the presidency of Pedro Parages </p>

         <p>The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920.
           At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title "Real Madrid,"
            meaning "Royal." Thus, Alfonso's crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.</p>

            <p>With the dissolution of the monarchy in 1931, all royal symbols
               (the crown on the crest and the title of Real) were eliminated.
               The crown was replaced by the dark mulberry band of the Region of Castile</p>

               <p>In 1941, two years after Nationalist victory in the Civil War,
                 the Francoist regime restored the crest's "Real Corona", or "Royal Crown",
                  while the mulberry stripe of Castile was retained as well. In addition,
                   the whole crest was made full color, with gold being the most prominent,
                    and the club went back to its honorific name Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.
                 The most recent modification to the crest occurred</p>

                <p>in 2001 when the club wanted to better situate itself for the 21st century and further standardize its crest.
                   One of the modifications made was changing the mulberry stripe to a more bluish shade.</p>
