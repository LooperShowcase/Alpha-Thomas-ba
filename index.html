      Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (Spanish pronunciation: [reˈal maˈðɾið ˈkluβ ðe
      ˈfuðβol] ⓘ), commonly referred to as Real Madrid, is a Spanish
      professional football club based in Madrid. The club competes in La Liga,
      the top tier of Spanish football. Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club,
      the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The
      honorific title real is Spanish for "royal" and was bestowed to the club
      by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem.
      Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 83,186-capacity Santiago
      Bernabéu in downtown Madrid since 1947
